# Public Repo
Here are some random scripts that I felt like sharing publicly. Enjoy!

#### iem_scraper_example.r
This script scrapes historical ASOS weather data from the [Iowa Environmental Mesonet](https://mesonet.agron.iastate.edu/request/download.phtml) site. It's basically a translation of Daryl Hertzmann's [Python script](https://github.com/akrherz/iem/blob/master/scripts/asos/iem_scraper_example.py) (which may or may not be more up to date).

#### covid19_analysis.R
Here's a script I wrote because I wanted to do some COVID-19 data analysis for myself and  was having trouble finding an API for good up-to-date state-level data. Eventually I found it and created [a simple static site](https://covid19.miketalbot.io/) to host some neat plots that I made, so use this script as a starting point if you're interested in doing something similar.

#### lakefinder_scraper.R
If you are interested in scraping lake level data from the Minnesota DNR's [Lake Finder](https://www.dnr.state.mn.us/lakefind/index.html) then look no further. If you're not then what do you do with all of your free time? You could be making something like [this](https://webapps.eorinc.io/lake-finder/). Get your priorities straight.
